My Trophies: Directories within my repository for each category of my work. 

For instance:

/certificates for your certificates.
/risk_assessments for your risk analysis assessments.
/checklists for your security checklists.
/projects for any projects or contributions to open source you want to showcase.


5. Showcase Each Item: For each document or certificate, consider creating a separate markdown file with a brief description. For example, for a risk assessment document, you might include:

The objectives of the assessment.

A summary of my findings.

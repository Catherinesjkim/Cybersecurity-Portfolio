Projects:

My Trophies: Directories within my repository for each category of my work. 

For instance:

/certificates for my certificates.
/risk_assessments for my risk analysis assessments.
/checklists for my security checklists.
/projects for any projects or contributions to open source I want to showcase.


5. Showcase Each Item: For each document or certificate, consider creating a separate markdown file with a brief description. For example, for a risk assessment document, you might include:

The objectives of the assessment.

- A summary of my findings.
- Any recommendations I made.
- Link back to these markdown files from my README.md for easy access.
